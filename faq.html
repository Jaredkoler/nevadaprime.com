      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">How does a lymphedema pump work?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A pneumatic compression device (PCD) uses air-filled chambers inside a specialized garment (sleeve or boot) that inflate and deflate in a sequential pattern. This creates a gentle, wave-like compression that moves excess lymphatic fluid out of the swollen limb and back toward the body's central circulation. Think of it as a mechanical massage that mimics what your lymphatic system should be doing naturally.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">How often should I use my compression pump?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Most physicians recommend using the pump for <strong>30–60 minutes per session, 1–2 times daily</strong>. Many patients use it while watching TV, reading, or relaxing. Your prescribing physician will provide specific instructions tailored to your condition. Consistency is key — regular use produces the best results.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Is pneumatic compression therapy painful?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>No. Most patients find compression therapy <strong>comfortable and relaxing</strong> — many describe it as a gentle massage. The pressure is fully adjustable from 10 to 120 mmHg, and your provider will set it to a level that is effective yet comfortable. If you experience any discomfort, the pressure can be easily adjusted.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Does Medicare cover lymphedema pumps?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p><strong>Yes.</strong> Medicare Part B covers pneumatic compression devices under HCPCS codes E0651 and E0652 when medical necessity is documented by your physician. Standard Medicare cost-sharing applies (typically 80/20 after deductible). We handle the entire insurance process for you. <a href="insurance.html">Learn more about coverage →</a></p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">What is the warranty on Bio Compression pumps?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Bio Compression Systems pumps come with a <strong>3-year manufacturer warranty</strong> — the longest in the pneumatic compression industry. This covers defects in materials and workmanship. Bio Compression is a family-run American manufacturer with over 35 years of experience, and their devices are built in the USA.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Can I travel with my compression pump?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Yes! Both the SC-2004-DL (3.3 lbs) and SC-4008-DL (3.85 lbs) are lightweight and portable. They're designed for home use but travel well. The compact size fits easily in a carry-on bag. Many patients take their pumps on trips to maintain their therapy schedule.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">How do I clean the compression garments?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Garments should be hand-washed with mild soap and lukewarm water, then air-dried. Do not machine wash, bleach, or tumble dry, as this can damage the air chambers. With proper care, garments last well. Replacement garments are available and may be covered by insurance.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">How do I know what size garment I need?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>We take measurements of the affected limb to determine proper sizing. Garments come in standard sizes, and Bio Compression also manufactures <strong>custom garments</strong> for patients with extreme swelling, tall dimensions, or limb loss — delivered in under 10 days. We'll ensure you get the right fit.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">What's the difference between the SC-2004-DL and SC-4008-DL?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>The <strong>SC-2004-DL</strong> is a 4-chamber system (HCPCS E0651) — lighter and simpler, great for many patients. The <strong>SC-4008-DL</strong> is an 8-chamber system (HCPCS E0652) with a touch-screen LCD, pre-therapy mode, and more precise gradient pressure control. Your physician will recommend the best option based on your condition. <a href="products.html">Compare models →</a></p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3 class="faq-question">Are there any side effects?</h3>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Pneumatic compression therapy is generally very safe. Some patients may experience mild temporary redness or tingling after use, which is normal. Your physician will screen for any contraindications (such as acute deep vein thrombosis or active infection) before prescribing the device.</p>
